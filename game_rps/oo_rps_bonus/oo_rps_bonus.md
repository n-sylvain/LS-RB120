Keeping score

Right now, the game doesn't have very much dramatic flair. It'll be more interesting if we were playing up to, say, 10 points. Whoever reaches 10 points first wins. Can you build this functionality? We have a new noun -- a score. Is that a new class, or a state of an existing class? You can explore both options and see which one works better.

Add Lizard and Spock

This is a variation on the normal Rock Paper Scissors game by adding two more options - Lizard and Spock. The full explanation and rules are here.

Add a class for each move

What would happen if we went even further and introduced 5 more classes, one for each move: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, and Spock. How would the code change? Can you make it work? After you're done, can you talk about whether this was a good design decision? What are the pros/cons?

Keep track of a history of moves

As long as the user doesn't quit, keep track of a history of moves by both the human and computer. What data structure will you reach for? Will you use a new class, or an existing class? What will the display output look like?

Computer personalities

We have a list of robot names for our Computer class, but other than the name, there's really nothing different about each of them. It'd be interesting to explore how to build different personalities for each robot. For example, R2D2 can always choose "rock". Or, "Hal" can have a very high tendency to choose "scissors", and rarely "rock", but never "paper". You can come up with the rules or personalities for each robot. How would you approach a feature like this?



=> keeping score and display score - ok
=> add lizard and spock gameplay - ok
=> add shorcut for move selection - ok
=> add a class for each move and hierarchy? - not sure how
=> move history - ok
=> choose your opponent
=> personality robot:
  -> purely random
  -> play last move
  => more scissors (...)
=> some display formatting - ok
